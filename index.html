            welcome to my heart *****
            didnt eat for days
            feeling cold like the arctic
            nothing to embrace

            no i cannot stop this
            i cannot win this
            life is a matrix
            i can't decode it

            feeling like my art shifts
            i hate it anyways
            theres nothing to it
            i chose the wrong way

            i miss the old me
            all my friends told me
            stop with the drugs
            they **** your head slowly

            and i didnt listen for ****
            thats what i got from it
            steady urge to ******** dip
            i wish i could handle it
            no friend cares about my shit
            making music for myself
            rainy days have come to hell
            depth strida breaks out his shell

            turned 22 some days ago
            feeling like my brain is getting slow
            wanna fill my chest cuz theres a hole
            all i ever had is ******** mold

            tired of life
            hide my darkness inside
            getting flood by a tide
            by the sorrow of mine

            now i dont wanna hide
            cause this shit feels too right
            welcome to my heart *****
            welcome to my heart

            welcome to my heart
